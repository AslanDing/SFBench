I saw on your website that SFWM was draining the waterways, but the water level was not noticeably lower before the storm. So after watching the destruction of many Broward community homes from major flooding issues, I must ask, why did this happen?   Was Broward not ready, were all the waterways drained properly, what happened?  We have had hurricanes with plenty of water in the past without such flooding and devastation to Broward.  So what was different this time and how will this not occur again? I am not in a flood zone and have not had an issue in 40 years living in this area of Davie. Today is day 2 after the tropical storm, the flood water around our neighborhood had not receded, it is still raining and we are still wondering how this will end?   I am one among many concerned Broward County residents who are asking the same questions.

About level with our properties elevation is a 5'x5' ""emergency"" drain. It layman terms I believe this sits too high for our neighborhood as our retention pond is very rapidly and often overwhelmed by average size rain storms. We would like to have this lowered to allow sooner release of our retention ponds water. Many of our homes have water inches from doorsteps during average rains.
